# tp-modal Killer

Do you ever get annoyed by those pesky Javascript overlays on news websites that 
obscure the text without changing the content? 

"Turn off my Ad-blocker? pshaw -- I don't think so!"

Do you ever just remove the DOM elements using the Inspector?

If this describes you, then you are in luck: This Chrome extension makes the
process a single button click!

## Notes

This project really was just a way for me to play around with creating a Chrome
extension, so it really doesn't do much of anything. But it is working, at least
for the overlays that are powered by "tp-modal". I'm sure the code could be much
better but for now it works. I may come back and clean up this project some
day... (But probably not)

For now, I'll be using this as is. _Enjoy!_
